Sam,

Here is an updated copy of DSPACE.  I updated the code that
originally existed on CBT Tape 426, File 369.

The DSPACE command only had a one line update to add support for
3380s emulated by a 2105 ESS (SHARK).  But, I rewrote the TSO
HELP text, updated the FDSPACE panel with 4-byte UCB support,
relaxed (eliminated) the restrictions imposed upon the user when
entering a volume serial number, added mount status, colorized
the panel and added more descriptive and meaningful panel text,
and replaced the customized mods from PRC with general ISPF API
calls to use the LMDDISP service to present the user with an ISPF
3.4 scrollable data set list.  Finally, I wrote 4 new ISPF HELP
panels.

The code was tested on a T/REX running ISPF 5.2, TSO/E 3.3, and
z/OS 1.3.0.  No statement of support whatsoever is implied by
this contribution.

Enjoy.... and let me know if you have any problems reading the
attachment.
