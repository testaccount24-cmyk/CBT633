% DASD Space+is an ISPF dialog that displays space utilization of online
  direct access storage devices in a scrollable, tabular format.  DASD Space
  is driven by a TSO CLIST which uses the%SYSOUTTRAP+facility to capture the
  PUTLINE output of the%DSPACE TSO command processor+and displays it in an
  ISPF storage resident table.  Consequently, DASD SPACE is entirely dependent
  upon the output that is generated by the DSPACE TSO command processor to
  properly function.

  DSPACE is an assembly language TSO command processor that uses the%UCBSCAN+
  and%LSPACE (SVC 78)+macros to obtain and display the following information
  about online direct access storage devices:%volume serial, index VTOC
  status, UNIT address, device type, mount attribute, and space utilization.
+ DASD space utilization consists of: 1. total no. of%free cylinders,+2. total
  no.  of of%free tracks,+3. total no. of%extents,+and 4. the maximum number
  of%contiguous cylinders and tracks.
